Digital Portfolio Builder

Digital Portfolio Builder is a powerful yet easy-to-use web application built with React that enables users to design and publish their own professional portfolio websites. This platform allows users to create personalized portfolios by simply filling out a structured and intuitive form, eliminating the need for any coding knowledge.

Getting Started

If you're interested in contributing to the Digital Portfolio Builder project or want to run it locally for development or testing purposes, you'll first need to set up your development environment. Follow the comprehensive steps below to get everything up and running.

Prerequisites

Before beginning the installation, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- Node.js: 
  Node is required to run the frontend and backend JavaScript code. If you don’t already have Node.js installed, you can download it from the official website: Node.js Download

- Git: 
  Git is used for version control and to clone the repository. If Git is not installed on your machine, you can download it here: Git Download

Installing Project Dependencies

Once you have all prerequisites installed, follow these steps to install the necessary packages and dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project’s frontend directory and install its dependencies:
   cd frontend
   npm install

3. After that, move to the backend directory and install the required backend dependencies:
   cd ../backend
   npm install

Running the Application

Now that all dependencies are installed, you’re ready to run the application. Follow the steps below to launch both the frontend and backend servers:

1. First, start the frontend server:
   cd frontend
   npm start

2. Then, in a new terminal window or tab, start the backend server:
   cd backend
   npm start

3. Once both servers are running, you can open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the Digital Portfolio Builder.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues such as connection errors, ensure that both the frontend and backend servers are running properly. Check the terminal for any error messages that may indicate what went wrong.
